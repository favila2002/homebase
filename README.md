ii. **What is a Math Puzzle in CICS?**
    My definition of a math puzzle is a game or task that that was designed with a mathmatical sense where the solution typically has a clever use of math properties. The puzzle also has to be entertaining to some degree, otherwise people would see it as some kind of homework assignment and those are not fun.
  
iii. **A Puzzle I Like**
    I like ARGs [alternate reality games] because they typically come out of nowhere and usually there is a prize if you are the first one to solve the ARG puzzle. One example is the book Ready Player One which consisted of various video game easter eggs and I thought the plot was cool. I did not like the second book Ready Player Two though. It was dissapointing.
